# Unit 1 - Asphalt Art

## Introduction

Cities use asphalt art to improve public safety, inspire their residents and visitors, and brighten communities. Your goal is to create asphalt art to revitalize The Neighborhood and bring the community together with the help of the Painter.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, algorithms, the problem solving process, and decomposition strategies to create asphalt art:
- **Create a new subclass** – Create at least one new subclass of the PainterPlus class that is used for a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Plan an algorithm** – Use the problem solving process and decomposition strategies to plan an algorithm that incorporates a combination of sequencing, selection, and/or iteration.
- **Write a method** – Write at least one method in a PainterPlus subclass that contributes to a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments.

## Notes: Neighborhood & Painter Class

This project was created on Code.org's JavaLab platform using the built in Neightborhood GUI output. To test and edit this project you must build in Code.org's JavaLab with the Neighborhood GUI enabled. For reference to the Painter class documentation, [you can read more here.](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Painter)

## Reflection

1. Describe your project.

   - During this project, I was able to create a bow in Java Lab. I was able to draw stars and a pink bow on the asphalt or canvas given. I made three classes, each being able to do its own thing. 

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

   - Two things about my project that I am proud of is that I was able to actually code the bow to look like how I imagined it by creating classes and putting code in each class. The second thing I am proud of is being able to debug and find the issue in my code if there was one. I felt like this helped me develop as a coder.

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

   - Something I would improve or do differently is maybe change some of the colors since they aren't the colors I had hoped to use and also doing something a little more complicated next time if I am able to.
